Hinglish Translator  created as assignment for Open_in_app


The Hinglish Translator is a Python script that leverages machine translation models to accurately translate English text into Hinglish, a blend of Hindi and English. The script offers two distinct translation methods: one utilizing a transformer model and the other employing Google Translate as a backup solution. This versatile tool also incorporates the capability for user-guided review of translations and word replacements to enhance the quality of the translated output.

Features
Advanced Translation Techniques: The script employs two methods for translation. The primary approach utilizes a transformer model based on Hugging Face's MarianMTModel. This model is designed to capture intricate language patterns and nuances, making it effective for generating high-quality translations. The script implements beam search and sets a maximum translation length for optimal results. In case of subpar translations, the script seamlessly switches to a backup solution using Google Translate, enhancing the overall accuracy.

User-Guided Review and Rating: After each translation attempt, the user is given the opportunity to review the quality of the output and provide a rating. The available ratings include "good," "bad," or "neutral." This user-centric review mechanism not only facilitates continuous improvement of translation accuracy but also ensures that the translated text aligns with the intended meaning.

Efficient Caching for Enhanced Performance: The script integrates a caching mechanism through the lru_cache decorator. This optimization technique stores previously translated text, reducing redundant translation requests for the same input. As a result, the script achieves improved performance and responsiveness.

Intelligent Word Replacements: To enhance the naturalness of the translated text and correct potential discrepancies, the script supports the replacement of specific words. The provided word_replacements dictionary allows for tailored replacements of certain words, both through regular expressions and simple string substitutions. This feature plays a pivotal role in producing translations that are not only accurate but also linguistically sound.

Customization and Configuration: The script is designed for adaptability and customization. By modifying the model_name and word_replacements variables within the main function, users can tailor the translation process to their specific needs. The model_name should point to a compatible transformer model, while the word_replacements dictionary can be expanded to include additional word replacements as necessary.

Getting Started

Installation: Begin by installing the necessary dependencies. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed and run the following commands to install the required libraries:

pip install transformers
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
Usage: To start using the Hinglish Translator, follow these steps:

a. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

b. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

c. Execute the script via the command line:

python hinglish_translator.py

d. The script will prompt you to review and rate translations based on your assessment of their quality.
